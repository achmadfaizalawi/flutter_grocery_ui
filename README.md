# Flutter Grocery UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, developments that have been carried out include:
1. Create a home page. Contains a menu app bar, shopping cart, search button, and list of products available.
2. Create a product detail page. Contains product images and descriptions, as well as purchase buttons.
4. Create a feature for adding and subtracting items in the product list and product details sections. Used to increase and decrease the number of items to be purchased.

## Usage

1. Click the '+' button and '-' button to increase and decrease the number of items. This button is found on the main page and product detail page.
2. To view the product description on the product detail page, you can press the product image on the main page.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ih2Joj9hgys?si=OGnWt278uhrnH3R7) platform.
