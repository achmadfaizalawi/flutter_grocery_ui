# Flutter Grocery UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, developments that have been carried out include:
1. Create a home page. Contains a menu app bar, shopping cart, search button, and list of products available.
2. Create a product detail page. Contains product images and descriptions, as well as purchase buttons.
4. Create a feature for adding and subtracting items in the product list and product details sections.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ih2Joj9hgys?si=OGnWt278uhrnH3R7) platform.
